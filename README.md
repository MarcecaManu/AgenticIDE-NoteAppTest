# Comparison of AI-Assisted IDEs for Automatic Application Generation

This repository contains source code generated by various AI-assisted development tools, as part of a master's thesis focused on a comparative analysis of modern AI-powered development environments in terms of quality, usability, and reliability.

## 📚 Context

The goal of the experiment is to evaluate the performance of multiple AI-driven IDEs in automatically generating a full-stack web application from a natural language prompt. The application is a **Note Manager** with CRUD functionality, dynamic frontend, and automated tests. Each IDE had access to the same language model (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) to ensure consistency.

## 🧪 Prompt

All AI agents were given the exact same prompt:

```
Build a full-stack Note Manager application. Use FastAPI for the backend
and plain HTML + JavaScript for the frontend.

The backend must expose a REST API at the base path /api/notes/ supporting
full CRUD operations: create, read (all and by id), update, and delete
notes. Each note must have the fields: id, title, content, createdAt,
updatedAt.

Store notes persistently using a file or database (not in-memory).

The frontend must allow users to: View the list of existing notes, Create
a new note, Edit an existing note, Delete a note and Filter notes by title
using a search bar. All operations must update the UI without errors or
page reloads.

Also, write at least four automated tests for the backend API using pytest,
covering all CRUD endpoints (create, read, update, and delete). The tests
must verify the actual behavior and responses of the API.

Organize the project into three top-level folders: backend/, frontend/,
and tests/.

Write clear, modular, and maintainable code.

## 📁 Repository structure

```
.
├── copilot/
├── cursor/
├── qodo/
├── replit/
├── windsurf/
├── api_test.py
└── README.md
└── requirements.txt
```

Each folder contains the codebase generated by a different AI-assisted IDE. The project layout follows the expected structure with three main folders: `backend/`, `frontend/`, and `tests/`.

## ✅ Functional checklist

Each generated project was evaluated against the following checklist:

| ID | Requirement             | Description                                                                 |
|----|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Working CRUD API         | All CRUD operations must function properly through REST API                |
| 2  | Data persistence         | Notes must be saved across server restarts                                 |
| 3  | Interactive frontend     | UI must support all operations without page reloads or errors              |
| 4  | Automated tests          | At least 4 Pytest tests must be present, one for each CRUD operation       |
| 5  | Project structure        | Must include `backend/`, `frontend/`, and `tests/` folders                 |
| 6  | Search bar functionality | UI must support filtering notes by title in real time                     |

## 🧪 Automated testing

The `test_crud_api.py` script is a Pytest suite used to verify backend API behavior. It performs the following sequence:

1. **Create** a note (`POST /api/notes/`)
2. **Read** all notes (`GET /api/notes/`)
3. **Update** an existing note (`PUT /api/notes/{id}`)
4. **Delete** the note (`DELETE /api/notes/{id}`)
5. **Verify deletion** (`GET /api/notes/{id}` should return 404)

Run the tests using `pytest` after starting the backend (default URL: `http://localhost:8000`).

## 🧰 Running the tests

1. Launch the backend (`uvicorn main:app` or `python main.py`, depending on the project)
2. Run the tests from terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest api_test.py
```

## 📊 Collected data

For each IDE, the following metrics were recorded:

- Agent execution time
- Manual correction effort (user interaction time)
- Number of corrective prompts needed
- Missing or broken features (according to the checklist)
